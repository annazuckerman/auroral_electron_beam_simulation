# auroral_electron_beam_simulation
Simulation of aurorally precipitating energetic electrons in H2 dominated substellar atmospheres.

Code used to produce results and plots for Zuckerman et al. 2025.

NB: This is a minimal version of the simulation, without functionality to restore from previous run or to save large amounts of iteration-by-iteration diagnostic information.
